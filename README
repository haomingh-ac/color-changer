## Building the module

```npm run build```

## Installing this module in your app

If you build the module and push it to an npm registry, you could install it in your app with `npm install --save color-changer`. However, since it is not published to a registry, the easy option is to build the module as shown above, then link to the local module:

```cd color-changer
npm link
cd ../your-app
npm link color-changer```

## Usage

In your code, add the following:

```import colorChanger from 'color-changer'

colorChanger()```

Your app's background color should change randomly without repetition once per second for 10 seconds.
